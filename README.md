### Welcome to my github profile



## Summary
I am an experienced engineering manager with a strong technical background in open source software.

Most recently, I have been building and managing a team of 11 talented Quality Engineers and led two collaborative task-forces by setting technical scope, collecting common needs, gathering feedback and communicating it to the department and stakeholders.
